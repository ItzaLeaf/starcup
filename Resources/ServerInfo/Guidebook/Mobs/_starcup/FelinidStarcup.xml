  By right-clicking a duffel bag placed on the ground and selecting "Insert yourself", you can climb inside and occupy it as though you were an item.

  While inside the duffel bag, you can take any items stored inside with you. Anyone can remove you in an instant, but escaping yourself takes a few seconds.

  ## Naming Traditions
  Felinids largely follow the same naming conventions as humans.
