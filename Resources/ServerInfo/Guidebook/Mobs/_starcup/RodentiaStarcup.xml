  ## Species Abilities
  ### Sneaking
  Rodentia have a toggleable Sneak Mode that allows you to slip underneath tables and counters, which not only lets you easily bypass these obstacles, but also hides you from view.

  ### Cheek Storage
  The cheeks of Rodentia can be used as a small storage compartment that can be accessed at any time. Do note, however, that any attempt at speech while carrying an item in your cheeks will be replaced with unintelligible mumbling!

  ### Duffel Critter

  By right-clicking a duffel bag placed on the ground and selecting "Insert yourself", you can climb inside and occupy it as though you were an item.

  While inside the duffel bag, you can take any items stored inside with you. Anyone can remove you in an instant, but escaping yourself takes a few seconds.

  ### Rummager

  Alt-clicking a disposal unit will let you start rummaging through it, producing a random item after a few seconds. Most of the time it'll be useless garbage, but occasionally you'll find food!

  ## Naming Traditions
  Rodentia have a single given name, typically derived from human etymology but sometimes integrating a favorite word, and a descriptive epithet that comes before it.

  Examples:
  - Quick-wit Rudy
  - Extravagant Thumpton
  - Sharp-tongued Amity
