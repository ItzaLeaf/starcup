  # Kobolds

  Small, sociable tunnel-dwellers from beneath the Saltgraves whose bloody history of raiding and piracy is belied by an overwhelming skittishness.

  Due to post-war growing pains, our kobold employees are not currently integrated into shift rotations.

  ## Naming Traditions
  Kobolds have a given name, traditionally with a single repeated vowel sound, and a surname in the form of a compound-word title that represents a notable service or failing to their warren. Many cultures with prominent raiding traditions have decided to eschew the usual given name in favor of naming themselves after a favorite food; it isn't often that a kobold gets to eat well.

  Examples:
  - Suagua the Goodsweep
  - Nildi the Quickdigger
  - Parfait the Bloodcoward
