  Bipedal primates allegedly identical to the persistence-hunting humans of Earth, claiming to refugees from the Solar System. Since the Solar System's existence has yet to be conclusively proven, no one has been able to verify these claims. That said, the breadth of the cultural identity humans brought with them cannot be understated.

  Humans have not been recorded as demonstrating any noteworthy physical advantages or weaknesses beyond that of other sapient creatures.

  ## Naming Traditions
  Humans have a large variety of different naming traditions depending on subculture, but most contain a given name assigned to them at birth by their parents and an inherited family name. These names are etymologically derived from the many different human languages. It's known that humans will sometimes replace one or both of these later in life as their identity and self-perception change over time.

  Examples:
  - Abhinav Maharjan
  - Zhang Min
  - Vicki Lynwood
