# starcup: rewrote plasma description for tone
# reagent-desc-plasma = Funky, space-magic pixie dust. You probably shouldn't eat this, but we both know you will anyways.
reagent-name-plasma = plasma
reagent-desc-plasma = This highly flammable gas is the fuel source that propelled NanoTrasen to the corporate dominance it lords over you now. It, like them, is to be dealt with very carefully.

reagent-name-tritium = tritium
reagent-desc-tritium = Radioactive space-magic pixie dust.

reagent-name-carbon-dioxide = carbon dioxide
reagent-desc-carbon-dioxide = You have genuinely no idea what this is.
